## Introduction

Use [Computer Use](https://developers.openai.com/docs/computer-use) when a task moves across desktop apps, windows, or local files. ChatGPT can click, type, and navigate the apps you allow, then return the result for review. For a website or signed-in browser session, start a separate browser task with `@Chrome`.

**Computer Use requires the ChatGPT desktop app.** In supported regions, Computer Use is available on macOS and Windows in ChatGPT Work and Codex. Cloud Work tasks on web or mobile cannot directly access your local apps, files, or signed-in desktop browser sessions. You can start or steer a desktop task from [Remote on mobile](https://developers.openai.com/codex/remote-connections) when you connect a Mac or Windows host.

Good examples include moving notes into a system of record, checking context across a few apps before drafting a reply, or copying approved details between tools that don't have a dedicated plugin.

Here is what a safe desktop handoff can look like when Messages and Notes contain your cabin-weekend plans:

**Desktop task:** Gather cabin-weekend ideas from Messages and a shortlist in Notes, create a local note, and draft a reply.

**Result:** Pine Lodge is step-free, within two hours, and costs $690 total. Lake House may work, but travel time and accessibility still need confirmation. Cedar Ridge is excluded because it has stairs. The group size is unknown, so per-person pricing stays conditional.

The local note and reply draft are ready for review. Nothing was booked or sent.




## How to use

1. Open the ChatGPT desktop app and install the [Computer Use plugin](https://developers.openai.com/docs/computer-use).
2. Start your request with `@Computer` for desktop apps or `@Chrome` for browser tasks.
3. Describe the task, the apps or files involved, and the result you want.
4. Review access prompts and pause before actions that send, submit, or change important data.
5. On Windows, keep the target app visible while Computer Use runs.

If a plugin exists for an app, ChatGPT may use the plugin for the structured action. Computer Use is useful when the task depends on the app interface or a plugin isn't available.

## Things to try

Start with one tool: use `@Computer` for desktop apps and local files, or `@Chrome` for your browser. ChatGPT can choose other tools as needed.

**Turn messages into a plan**



**Prompt:**

```text
@Computer Check my Messages for our weekend trip, compare the cabin shortlist in Notes, and draft a reply. Don't send it.
```

**Find places to stay**



**Prompt:**

```text
@Chrome Search Airbnb for cabins within two hours of San Francisco. Compare price, availability, cancellation policy, and step-free access. Don't book anything.
```

**Catch up on a project**



**Prompt:**

```text
@Computer Check my project tracker and recent messages. Tell me what's changed, what's blocked, and which follow-ups I need to send. Don't message anyone.
```

**Update a tracker from meeting notes**



**Prompt:**

```text
@Computer Open my meeting notes, find the decisions and action items, and prepare the matching updates in the project tracker. Ask me before submitting anything.
```

**Work in your signed-in browser**



**Prompt:**

```text
@Chrome Open the customer account in my signed-in browser, check the latest activity and support tickets, and draft a quick update. Don't send it.
```

**Test a website**



**Prompt:**

```text
@Chrome Open http://localhost:3000, check the pricing page on mobile, and tell me what needs fixing. Don't publish or submit anything.
```

**Clean up local files**



**Prompt:**

```text
@Computer Review my Downloads folder and show me how you'd organize the project files. Ask before moving or deleting anything.
```

**Show it what you're looking at**

On macOS, use an [appshot](https://developers.openai.com/codex/appshots) to share the app window in front of you. Appshots provide visual context; Computer Use can then open, inspect, and interact with the app if you allow it.



**Prompt:**

```text
@Computer Look at this AppShot, find the same screen in the app, and tell me what I need to do. Ask before changing anything.
```

## Practical tips

### Understand how the task runs on each computer

On macOS, Computer Use can work in the background while you use other apps. A picture-in-picture preview shows the active app; open the preview to follow along or move it out of the way. If you use a Pet, you can move the preview there.

On Windows, Computer Use runs on the active desktop and takes over the foreground. Expect the pointer and keyboard to move while the task runs. Keep the device unlocked and connected, or run the desktop app in a Windows virtual machine if you need to keep using your main desktop.

### Choose the right browser

Browser tasks are often part of Computer Use. Choose the browser that has the context you need:

- **[Chrome extension](https://developers.openai.com/codex/chrome-extension):** Use `@Chrome` for browser tasks, including listing searches, websites, and your existing signed-in Chrome profile, tabs, or extensions.
- **[Built-in browser](https://developers.openai.com/codex/browser?surface=app):** Use it when you want a separate browser session for localhost or public sites. It has its own browser state and can wait while you sign in.
- **Cloud browser in ChatGPT Work on web or mobile:** Use it for supported public, signed-out sites. It cannot access local files, open tabs, extensions, or saved passwords, sign in to sites, or complete payments.

Name the browser in the prompt when it matters, and use [customization](https://developers.openai.com/docs/customization/overview) for a recurring desktop preference.

### Avoid parallel runs in the same app

Do not run two Computer Use tasks against the same app at the same time. Competing actions can change the current window or state and make the result unreliable.

### Prepare signed-in apps and locked use

Before starting a desktop task, sign in to the apps and services it needs. On macOS, you can enable [locked use](https://developers.openai.com/docs/computer-use#locked-use) if the task must continue after the Mac locks. Locked use is not available for Windows Computer Use.
